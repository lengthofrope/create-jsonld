/**
 * A [[NewsArticle]] providing historical context, definition and detail on a specific topic (aka "explainer" or "backgrounder"). For example, an in-depth article or frequently-asked-questions ([FAQ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FAQ)) document on topics such as Climate Change or the European Union. Other kinds of background material from a non-news setting are often described using [[Book]] or [[Article]], in particular [[ScholarlyArticle]]. See also [[NewsArticle]] for related vocabulary from a learning/education perspective.
